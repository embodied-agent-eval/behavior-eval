The initial states show that both alarms are on top of the coffee table, and neither is toggled on. The goal states require both alarms to be toggled on and the surrounding surfaces to be clean.\n2. The first subgoal is to keep the alarms on top of the coffee table, which is already satisfied.\n3. The second subgoal is to toggle on the alarms. Since the robot can only hold one object in one hand, it needs to hold the alarm and toggle it on. This is represented by \"holds_rh(carving_knife.0)\".\n4. The third subgoal is to toggle on both alarms. This is represented by \"toggledon(alarm.0) and toggledon(alarm.1)\".\n5. The fourth subgoal is to clean the surrounding surfaces. Since the alarms are already toggled on, the robot can now clean the surfaces. This is represented by \"inside(alarm.0, dishwasher or sink)\" and \"toggledon(dishwasher or sink)\".\n6. The final subgoal is to ensure that the surrounding surfaces are clean. This is represented by \"not dusty(breakfast_table.20) and not dusty(coffee_table.27) and not dusty(room_floor_living_room.0)\".\n\nNote that the subgoal plan is in temporal order, and each subgoal is a boolean expression that is consistent and logical."

Initially, all three houseplants are on the floor. The robot needs to pick them up.\n2. The robot holds a watering can in its right hand.\n3. The robot waters all three houseplants, making them soaked.\n4. Finally, the robot ensures that all three houseplants are not soaked.\n\nNote that I did not use any quantifiers like \"forall\" or \"exists\" in the output, and the states are presented in a logical and reasonable order to achieve the final goal states."
